    <h3>Here's a timeline of Mahatma Gandhi's life:</h3>
    &nbsp
   <ul>
     <li><span>october 2 1869</span> - Born in porbandar district, Gujrat</li>
     <li><span>30 January 1948</span> - Assasinated by Nathu Ram Godse "</li>
    </ul>

    &nbsp;

  <p>"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi", aka Mahatma Gandhi, was born on 2nd October 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, worked as the Chief Minister of the Princely state of Porbandar. </p>

<p> Mahatma Gandhi did his schooling at Alfred High School in Gujarat and went on to study law at the University of London. Mahatma Gandhi married Kasturba Gandhi in 1883. He left for England to study law in 1988 after their first child Hiralal was born. </p>
    
<p> He acquired a law degree. However, he soon found out that this was not his calling in life. He left his profession and joined the freedom struggle. He inspired several Indians to follow the path of non-violence to fight the British. </p>
    
<p> The British were finally thrown out of the Country in 1947, and Mahatma Gandhi played a major rule. Unfortunately, we lost Gandhiji on 30th January 1948. Nathuram Godse fired three bullets in his chest, and he surrendered to death. </p>
